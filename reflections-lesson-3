When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are collaborating on a project with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there may be times when you don't want to add changes from the remote repository to your local repository
