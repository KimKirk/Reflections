When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are collaborating on a project with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there may be times when you don't want to add changes from the remote repository to your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are used on GitHub only when you want to use all commits from a repository
clones are used to get commits from a remote repository onto your local computer
branches are used on a single repository where you want to add changes but keep the master the same until you choose to merge with changes
