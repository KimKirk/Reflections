How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it allowed me to see specifically what was changed which narrowed
down the search field.
then I was able to more easily find the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

you don't spend as much time searching through your code to find the differences


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because some version control systems are designed strictly for version control and others have a text editor in place

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: you can control what to commit, you won't commit in the middle of a line and make that version not compile
cons: you may forget to commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
look at the log, get the commit id, use git diff to compare one git id with another

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can revert back to version that had no bugs and you could see where the lines of code changed to specifically see what bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I'm using it for code that I create for my Java textbook assignments
